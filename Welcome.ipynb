    "This winter ('20) at Phillips Exeter Academy we worked on a senior project in quantum computing, seeking to learn some of the theory and implications of quantum computation as well as run code on a real quantum computer. We began by studying quantum bits, gates, and circuits using David McMahon’s text *Quantum Computing Explained* \\[1\\]. To practice manipulating quantum bits, we used the Python quantum programming library [pyQuil](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil) and the [Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM)](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm), a quantum simulator developed at [Rigetti Computing](https://rigetti.com) \\[2\\]. We simulated several quantum states such as the [Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) \\[3\\] state, a generalized version of a simple entangled state. We also investigated the [Deutsch-Josza algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) \\[4\\], one of the first algorithms created to demonstrate quantum advantage over a classical computer. In the last several weeks of our project, we used Rigetti’s Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform \\[5\\] to run code on a real Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), and documented our results.\n",
